# Welcome to the CSAEA Binder Sandbox!

Welcome to the **CSAEA Binder Sandbox**! Here, we provide an "ephemeral coding" environment—think of it as a temporary coding lab where you can experiment without the risk of messing up anything important. When you spin up a JupyterLab server, you’re launching an interactive space right in your browser where you can write, run, and debug code in real time. 

## Table of Contents

- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Folder Structure](#folder-structure)
- [Lessons Overview](#lessons-overview)
- [How to Use This Sandbox](#how-to-use-this-sandbox)

## Getting Started

Ready to get coding? Right-click the badge below and open it in a new tab:
