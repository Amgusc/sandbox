# The CSAEA Sandbox

Welcome to the CSAEA Sandbox, where you can use JupyterLab and Biner to practice temporary, ephemeral coding. In other words, Binder will **not** save your work! What!? This is by design. Think of it as a whiteboard, an experimental lab to explore without consequence. 

Once you fire up the JupyterLab Binder, you’ll find an interactive coding environment waiting for you right in your browser. It might take a minute to get going—just let it do its thing.

## How to Use This Sandbox

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/csaea/my-first-binder/HEAD)

1. Right click the **Binder** badge above and launch your JupyterLab workspace in a new tab or window. 
2. Navigate through the folders to find lessons and resources.
3. Dive into the content with the class, or at your own pace.

It can take anywhere from a minute to a small eternity to load, so check out these links!

- **[Python Challenges](https://pythonprinciples.com/challenges/Capital-indexes/)**: A free list of Python challenges. 

## What is JupyterLab?

[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) is a robust, web-based interactive development environment (IDE). It allows you to write code in notebooks, visualize data, and share your work—all in one place.

Some highlights:

- **Interactive Notebooks**: Code, text, images, and visualizations in a single document.
- **File Management**: Keep your scripts, notebooks, and data organized in one workspace.

For more details, check out the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/) and the [JupyterLab docs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The [community](https://jupyter.org/community) is also a great place for support.

## What is Binder?

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) makes GitHub repositories come to life by turning them into interactive Jupyter notebooks. It’s a seamless way to share your code and make it executable directly in a browser—no installation needed.

Binder creates a Docker image of your repository, bundles all the dependencies, and provides a working environment where users can run your notebooks. It’s an efficient way to make code accessible and reproducible.
