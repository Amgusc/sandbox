# Exercises for Ephemeral Coding

**Ephemera**
e·phem·er·a
/əˈfem(ə)rə/

**noun**
things that exist or are used or enjoyed for only a short time.

## Purpose 

In this repo, you'll find a variety of coding exercises, which we call **ephemera**. Use them in the spirit of play, experimentation, and experience. There are no consequences, scores, or ratings. Just pure code.  

The purpose of them is to strengthen your skills, your memory, and your speed. Similar to a physical exercise, like swimming laps, or practicing shooting a goal, or hitting a target, the purpose is to BULK UP! 

The purpose is to become more experienced, and stronger as programmer, rather than develop and save a deployable program. 

## What is Ephemeral Coding?

Ephemeral refers to something temporary, lasting a very short time. Ephemeral coding (ie, temporary coding) is a learning technique that focuses on writing code that disappears. Why? Because it emphasizes your understanding and comprehension of the code, rather than the syntax itself. In time, you will learn to think like a programmer, and not a copy/paster.
