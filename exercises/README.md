# Exercises for Ephemeral Coding

## Purpose 

In this repo, you'll find a variety of coding exercises. The purpose of them is to strengthen your skills, your memory, and your speed. Similar to a physical exercise, like swimming laps, or practicing shooting a goal, or hitting a target, the purpose is to BULK UP! The purpose is to become more experienced, and stronger as programmer, rather than develop and save a deployable program. 

Use them in the spirit of play, experimentation, and experience. There are no consequences, scores, or ratings. Just pure code.
